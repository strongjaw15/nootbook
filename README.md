Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Description

I wanted a super simple notebook-like app on my Android phone for creating and editing .txt files, and decided it was a great opportunity to learn how to make android apps, coming from a web development background. So that's what this is: a simple .txt editing app for Android. I learned a lot about using React Native to turn code into an Android app!

## Features

- Text Editing

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
